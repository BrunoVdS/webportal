# Reticulum installation
The installation script provisions Reticulum inside an isolated virtual environment located at `/opt/reticulum-venv` and exposes the `rn*` command-line tools via symlinks in `/usr/local/bin`. This avoids modifying system Python packages while keeping the utilities globally accessible.
